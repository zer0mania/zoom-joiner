You can configure the default camera device in config.txt by going to chrome://settings/content/camera and reading the option value of the selected camera interface with inspect element. Once you have copied it you may put the camera code in the parentheses according to default_video_capture_Device. Same goes for the microphone by going to chrome://settings/content/microphone and changing the default_audio_capture_device key value. If none is specified It will use the default settings.

You can also use a list by changing the list key to true, same goes for the API. Both activated will result in just the api being used by default.

I am not responsible for what you do with this tool and this is just intended for testing purposes.
